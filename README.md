## Advancement
A more advanced research system for civilization advances.
  * papers - scholars
  * insights - scientists, (discontentment, repressions, wars, disasters reduces probability for insights;)
  * experiments - scientists and engineers
Technologies need insights and experiments. Theories need insights and papers. 
Theories are needed for building Engines. Engines are needed by Buildings and Units 
Theories can be advanced by writing papers and experimenting, Theories can be used to make Technologies
Papers from other nations can be used to advance your science without the need to experiment or have insights.
Engineers can build engines or contribute to experimental projects. Engineers can also add to units to serve as mechanics or 
Advancement -> Units, Engines, Buildings, Wonders, novel Advancements, bonuses to unlock previous advancements.

## Building 
City improvements, National Wonders, Wonders of the World, Land and Sea Improvements

## Commerce
Increases connections between civs. Improves the incomes of the middle and upper classes. Investments into foreign market's 
Buildings can bring additional tax incomes for the civilization.

## Culture
Arts, prose, architecture and music, movies and games all advance the culture and provide works for foreign trade.

## Design
Once the mechanics of the game are ready, modules can be built for altering the design of the game. Initial design side of the 
game will be very simple.

## Development
You can develop a unit's skills and tool use with Great Artists, Scientists, Engineers, Leaders.

## Demilitarisation
As the game advances humanity becomes more civil by using less military, pursuing peace and prosperity to construct a better 
world. 

## Loyalty
Polarisation multiplies the amount of influence between the two civs - opposing politics and economies and religions make
propaganda easier.
Propaganda alters the amount of loyalty and antipathy and sympathy for other civs.
Great Scientists can leave by dissent if discontentment is supressed by police and military means.
